# Advanced methods in Big Data 

The main project will be in the PDF file


This is instructions to replicate our results of our projet on Opioids Used in USA 

We have 5 scripts : 

- The 1) 
        <br/> **Data pre-processing.ipynb** use for cleaned the database and for descriptives statistiques 
<br/> For the USA map : use also the database : "usa_states.csv"
- The 2) 
  <br/>      **selection de variables -2-3.ipynb** which is composed of the methods seen in progress with S. Laurent with Lasso, Ridge, PCA, Elastic Net
   <br/>     **Forward_final.ipynb** with Forward method 
- The 3) 
     <br/>   **modele.ipynb** which is composed of the methods seen in progress with P. Michel with Kmeans, Kmeans with PCA, Gradient Descent Algorithm, Artificial Neural Network 
- The 4) 
     <br/>    **Model_LDA.ipynb**
     <br/>   **Model_RF.ipynb**
     <br/>   **Models_KNN.ipynb**
     <br/>   **Models_SVM.ipynb** which is composed of the methods seen in progress with E.Gallic with LDA, Random Forest, KNN and SVM 
     
     
  <br/> the original database was sent by we transfer, this is the file : opioid_use_data.csv
