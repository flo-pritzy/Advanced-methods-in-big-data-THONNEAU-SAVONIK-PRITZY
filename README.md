# Advanced methods in Big Data 

This is instructions to replicate our results of our projet on Opioids Used in USA 

We have 5 scripts : 

- The 1) 
        Data pre-processing.ipynb use for cleaned the database and for descriptives statistiques 
For the USA map : use also the database : "usa_states.csv"
- The 2) 
        selection de variables -2-3.ipynb which is composed of the methods seen in progress with S. Laurent with Lasso, Ridge, PCA, Elastic Net
        Forward_final.ipynb with Forward method 
- The 3) 
        modele.ipynb which is composed of the methods seen in progress with P. Michel with Kmeans, Kmeans with PCA, Gradient Descent Algorithm, Artificial Neural Network 
- The 4) 
        Model_LDA.ipynb
        Model_RF.ipynb
        Models_KNN.ipynb
        Models_SVM.ipynb which is composed of the methods seen in progress with E.Gallic with LDA, Random Forest, KNN and SVM
